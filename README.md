# Simple Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) Pipeline

This repository contains a **simple bash script** to process Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) data, from raw FASTQ files to variant calling. It is designed for beginners and can be easily customized for production workflows.

---

## üß© Overview

The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **Quality Control (FastQC)**  
   Generates QC reports for raw FASTQ files.  

2. **Read Trimming (fastp)**  
   Removes adapters and low-quality bases.  

3. **Alignment (BWA-MEM)**  
   Aligns reads to the human reference genome (GRCh38).  

4. **SAM to BAM Conversion, Sorting, and Indexing (SAMtools)**  
   Converts the SAM file to BAM, sorts, and indexes it.  

5. **Variant Calling (GATK HaplotypeCaller)**  
   Generates a raw VCF file with variants.  

6. **Annotation (Future)**  
   Placeholder for integrating annotation tools such as ANNOVAR or VEP.
